## 1. The Beginning
Everything began on lovely Monday afternoon class. It was the first day of school and the teacher told us we would be hosting projects. It could have been anything, but it would benefit us more, if it would be in our own fields. 
After he had introduced us our job that we would be doing in 3 Months, everyone started rushing to find a pair or multiple pairs. Me, Virginia and Nikhil decided to go together for our projects. Mr Neil suddenly announced saying: “People who are in bigger groups will have an easier time displaying who’s doing what and that is why they’ll be graded much more strictly.” This was kind of alarming because we were one of the bigger groups, but we decided to stay together for the sake of our project.

## 2. The Idea 
We got our idea with the help of our teacher, Mr. Neil. He was showing us previous projects done by the year before us and one of the ideas were programming a website. We really liked the idea, so we decided to go for it.

## 3. Planning
Now we didn’t know what our website was going to be about, so we decided that we would all start collecting ideas, which was an event planner, a blog making site and a tourist guide to Zürich. At last, we decided to make a Zürich tourist guide website. We made a Assessment brief and we were ready to execute our project.

## 4. The Evaluation/ Decision 
After the planning, we decided to give every person a role. Virginia assured us on searching information for Zürich and Nikhil and I decided to do the programming for the site. Including programming the site, I took the role of doing the documentation, IPERKA, and as well the presentation.

## 5. The Realisation
Everything was going smoothly till we had to show Mr Neil where we were at. I realised I wasn’t being a big contribute to the programming. Because Nikhil had experiences of programming a site, he didn’t need much of my offers to the programming and we decided to make a new plan. 
Instead of me programming, I will be designing the site and also doing my previous roles. We all agreed and proceeded on.


If theres anything you, Virginia or Nikhil want to add in the realisation part which you did, add it in this section
z.B:
Virginia: where I got the infos for the site (research,…), what application I used, how it went, difficulties
Nikhil: what application I used, how it went, difficulties

##5. The Control
We checked our mistakes..
Nikhil:  how did u check for the mistakes
Test case  excel sheet

##6. The Assessment
How was the group assignment, how was the communication, did everything go smoothly, what do we wish to change, does the website function properly, do we have everything we want on the site?
Qs that need to be answered ^^
